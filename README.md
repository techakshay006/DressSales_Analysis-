# DressSales_Analysis-
Here, you will find very interesting EDA analysis on Retail Sales.

In accordance with 2 Data sets :
  1> Attribute_Dataset
  2> Dress_Sales
  
1. Attribute_Dataset sets contains 479 rows x 13 columns where it defines the Dress Id , Style of dress, Cost of Dress, Material or which fabric type is used etc.
2. Dress_sales sets contains 479 rows x 24 columns where it defines the Dress Id and corresponding how much individual sales happend in particular day.

So, here one can find the analysis regarding how much sales is driven in which season, in which category, in which style and many more.

But, before we proceed further one thing to be note while having EDA analysis which is Data should be clean and efficient to have analysis.

Thankyou for stopping by here and noe lets see which all steps need to be followed after getting data with an example of this category.

1. Data Cleaning:

    --Why data cleaning is important?
    --Because when we get the data we observe there may be some missing values, wrong data types, invalid values etc, so we have to fix all this.

So, steps involved to do this are

      a. Data types Identification.
      b. See any vulnurability in rows and columns and fix it.
      c. Try to analyze what should be done with missing values remove/impute.
      d. There may be outliers need to be handle.
      e. Must be invalid values as well fix them.
      f. Last but not the least standardize the values and filter the data which is required for analysis.

2. Univariate Analysis

      --Why univariate analysis is important?
      --Because it gives exposure to handle missing values, invalid values, outliers in single column or variable analysis.
      
a. Categorical unordered analysis (means data which contains non mesurable items)
b. Categorical Ordered Analysis (means data which contains measurable items)
c. Statistics on Numerical features (means quantitative analysis)

3. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

      --Why Bivariate & Multivariate is important?
      --Becaise it allows us to analyse 2 or more than 2 variable/columns analysis.
      
a. Numeric-Numeric Analysis (Self explanatory term analysis between 2 numeric variables/columns)
b. Numeric-Categorical Analysis (Pretty much self explanatory term analysis between one numeric and one categorical variables/columns)
c. Categorical-Categorical Analysis (This term also explains straight analysis between 2 categorical variables/columns)
d. Multivariate Analysis (More that 2 variables/columns analysis, preferably plot is heatmap)
e. Correlation vs Causation (Does not imply all the time with each other means Spurious Correlations -- refer to this website for more insights "tylervigen.com" )

Now, you have better understanding on EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis). 

Let's go and see some practical visuals one by one step. 

Thank you!
